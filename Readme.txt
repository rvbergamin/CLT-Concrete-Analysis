1. OVERVIEW        
CLT-Concrete Analysis is a MATLAB program designed for the structural 
analysis of systems composed of Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) and concrete
elements. This tool facilitates the assessment of structural integrity, 
ultimate limit states (ULS), and serviceability limit states (SLS) under
various loading conditions.

2. FEATURES 
 - Geometric and material property calculations.
 - Connector analysis and section property determination.
 - Ultimate limit state (ULS) checks for concrete and CLT components.
 - Serviceability limit state (SLS) assessments, including instantaneous
   and final displacements.
 - Visualization of results through informative plots.
 - Detailed report generation summarizing structural performance.

3. GETTING STARTED
3.1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.

3.2. Installation
 - Clone the files of repository:
 - Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.
 - Run the main script:
	Main.m

3.3. Usage
 - Modify input parameters in the script to match your structure's 
   specifications.
 - Run the script to perform the analysis.
 - Review the generated Results.txt file for a comprehensive summary.

3.4. Results 
The program generates detailed results, including:
 - Verification of ULS and SLS requirements.
 - Visualization of key structural behaviors.
 - Recommendations for connector spacing and layout.
